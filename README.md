# LLM Chatbot Application

Welcome to the **LLM Chatbot Application** — an end-to-end full-stack project built to showcase and reinforce my skills in modern web development and AI integration. This application features a basic chatbot powered by a large language model, with a robust tech stack including:

- **Frontend:**

  - **React** for dynamic UI components
  - **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling

- **Backend:**

  - **Node.js** with **Express** to build a RESTful API
  - **MongoDB** for data storage and management

- **Authentication:**

  - **Auth0** for secure user authentication and authorization

- **Development & Testing Tools:**

  - **ngrok** to expose the local development server for testing external integrations

- **LLM Integration:**
  - For the chatbot functionality, I plan to integrate the **OpenAI ChatGPT API** (or a similar LLM API) to handle natural language understanding and response generation

This project serves both as a personal learning journal and a portfolio piece — demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate a modern authentication system, backend services, and cutting-edge AI to build a functional chatbot. Whether you’re interested in full-stack development, authentication, or LLM integrations, I hope this project offers valuable insights and inspiration.

Feel free to adjust any details to better match your specific setup or preferences.

Happy coding!
